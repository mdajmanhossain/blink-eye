## The 20-20-20 Rule

The **20-20-20 rule** is a guideline to reduce eye strain caused by staring at screens for extended periods. It suggests that for every **20 minutes** spent looking at a screen, you should take a **20-second break** and focus your eyes on something at least **20 feet away**.

### Benefits:

- **Reduces Eye Strain:** Regular breaks help prevent eye fatigue and strain caused by prolonged screen time.
- **Improves Focus:** Taking short breaks can help maintain focus and productivity throughout the day.
- **Prevents Dry Eyes:** Looking away from the screen allows your eyes to blink more frequently, reducing the risk of dry eyes.
- **Promotes Eye Health:** Focusing on distant objects helps relax eye muscles and reduce the risk of developing vision-related issues.
